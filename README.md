This graph shows the run time of a recursively defined function that sums the fibinacci sequence. As seen the photo it has a linear run time or O(n). As the input increases so does the time it takes to compute the sum.

This is the image of the fibinacci using the decorator timer which takes the runtime of the function at every input from 1 to 100.


The second file called PythonRefresher is a program that mimics the echo affect. It takes a string and returns the amount of characters equal to the number of repetitions given (the defualt being 3). So given a string such as echo123 it'll repeat 3 times removing one character each time so output would be 123,23,3,.
