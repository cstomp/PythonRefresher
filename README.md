This graph shows the run time of a recursively defined function that sums the fibinacci sequence. As seen the photo it has a linear run time or O(n). As the input increases so does the time it takes to compute the sum.

The second file called PythonRefresher is a program that mimics the echo affect. It takes a string and returns the amount of characters equal to the number of repetitions given (the defualt being 3). So given a string such as echo123 it'll repeat 3 times removing one character each time so output would be 123,23,3,.
